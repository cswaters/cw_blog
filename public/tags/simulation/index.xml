      <description>Most of this was written a while back, I wouldn’t code some of the simulations the same way now, but everything still works so it’s being left as is.
The packages needed for examples below.
library(gridExtra) library(tidyverse) theme_set(theme_minimal()) Selling Flap-Doddle Handicappers that sell their picks to the general public don’t win and are a bad bet for gamblers.
note: the only long term documented exception to this rule I know of is RAS but as they say “one point does not a trend make.</description>

      <description>So far we’ve been using a flat betting model where our bettors bet size never varies. While this might be easier to model it isn’t very realistic. We could go with something like the Kelly criterion to determine the bet size but we’ll opt for easy again and use “x” percentage of the bettor’s bankroll. This means instead of using an infinite bankroll where a player can never run out of money we will start with a fixed sum.</description>
