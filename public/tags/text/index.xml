      <description>Text Analysis of Political Tracts The concepts and programming style in this post are inspired by the book “Text Mining in R”.
Most text mining tutorials you’ll come across on the web use modern (as in the last year to decade) sources. Way too many use twitter data. There might be value in sampling the “collective conscious” of the twitter-verse (I’m skeptical) but analysis of documents that have stood the test of time seems a more worthy endeavor.</description>

I didn’t have the original data set. Let’s see how trivial it is to create the document.</description>
