I am CDO at [VoteStrategies](https://votestrategies.com) a political consulting firm. 
    
Below are some of the demos we send to potential clients:

+ [Showcase](https://vs-showcase.netlify.com)
+ [Demo Analysis of District](https://vs-i-demo-district.netlify.com)
+ [Static Plots District Analysis](https://vs-demo-data-district.netlify.com)

I'm also in the process of putting together a book on applying R to sports betting. It probably won't be done anytime soon but I've started putting up some of the scripts to github. It's focused on US sports, mainly NFL and NBA.

+ [Betting with R Book (work in progress)](https://github.com/cswaters/betting_with_R_bookfiles)
