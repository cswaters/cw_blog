I'm a data scientist at a political consulting firm. 
    
Here's some examples of work I've done in politics.

I'm also in the process of putting together a book on applying R to sports betting. It probably won't be done anytime soon but I've started putting up some of the scripts to github. It's focused on US sports, mainly NFL and NBA.

In the past I created all the statistical material, edited, and wrote some of the content for the OOBG magazine. 

[Here's the 2017 edition](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ets1ajtdgwv22m2/2017%20OOBG%20English.pdf?dl=1) (the last year I was involved).
