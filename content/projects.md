I am CDO at [VoteStrategies](https://votestrategies.com) a political consulting firm. 
    
Below are some of the demos we send to potential clients:

+ [Showcase](https://vs-showcase.netlify.com)
+ [Demo Analysis of District](https://vs-i-demo-district.netlify.com)
+ [Static Plots District Analysis](https://vs-demo-data-district.netlify.com)

I'm also in the process of putting together a book on applying R to sports betting. It probably won't be done anytime soon but I've started putting up some of the scripts to github. It's focused on US sports, mainly NFL and NBA.

+ [Betting with R Book (work in progress)](https://github.com/cswaters/betting_with_R_bookfiles)

In the past I created all the statistical material, edited, and wrote some of the content for the OOBG magazine. 

[Here's the 2017 edition](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ets1ajtdgwv22m2/2017%20OOBG%20English.pdf?dl=1) (the last year I was involved).

[And the Vietnamese (catering to Vietnamese Americans) version of the magazine](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9n4mss9xrj09ien/OOBG%20Vietnamese.pdf?dl=1)
